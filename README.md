An attempt to build a real-time strategy game.

## Prerequisites

This project requires:
  * [Cross-platform Make (CMake)](http://www.cmake.org/) ~> 3.0
  * GNU Make or equivalent.
  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.
  * [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/) v1.37+ [HEADERS and LIBRARIES]
  * [Qt Framework](https://qt-project.org/) v5.4+
  * [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) ~> 3.0
  * [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) ~> 1.11
  * Log4Cxx v0.10.0+
  * googletest

## Building

This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
the typical build invocation of `./configure` followed by `make` will work.
For a list of all possible build targets, use the command `make help`.

NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

## Installing

Once the project has been built (see "Building"), execute `sudo make install`.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome.
